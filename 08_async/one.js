js engine is single threaded but along with web apis of browser it is 
very powerful

//Default Javascript
Javascript 
        --> synchronous and single threaded

// Each operation waits for the last one to 
complete before execution
Execution context
        --> execute one line of code at a time
        --> console log 1
        --> console log 2
        --> CALL STACK     MEMORY HEAP

//Blocking Code Vs Non-Blocking code

1.Blocking -> block the flow of program(read file Sync)
2.Non-Blocking ->does not block the flow of program(Read file Async)

javascript is syhnoronous

javascript with setinterval and settimeout is asyhnorous

javscript with api is async

javascript default engine is sync

but javascript with its runtime is async
